In street art the subjects that attach Matthias Mross might seem as not entirely new – but how he does his works is more than fresh and thrilling. His catchy eye and an immense talent make his hyper-realistic works not only authentic but actually groundbreaking. Although he is still being invited to paint on walls, his smaller scale pieces are taking his talent to the next level. ",

The composition of the painting consisted of colorful circles – I tried to convey music through this picture. Subsequently, drawing became the primary source of my communication. As growing up, I created paintings on huge canvases and papers.",

Furthermore, I'm a really fun loving person and always up for anything. In any way, my brain seems to link all these information and emotions and to reissue them in form of my paintings.

His practice focuses on reinterpreting reality through the visualization of recurring color contrasts. Getting his influence from the glitch art aesthetic, he attempts to intercommunicate parallel stories narrated through multiple layers of movement, form, and texture. His figurative expression becomes part of an abstract language where malfunction, error, and deformation coexist in an environment of harmonic deconstruction.",
